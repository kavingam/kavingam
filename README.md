| Advance Sentiment Analysis Transformer (ASAT)| Advanced sentiment analysis involves using deep learning models, particularly transformers like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text. The process begins with tokenization, where text is split into tokens. These tokens are then converted into embeddings, which are numerical vectors representing the semantic meaning of words. The transformer model processes these embeddings using layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks to capture contextual relationships within the text. The output is passed through a classifier that assigns sentiment labels based on the processed data. | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/get_link-click-green?logo=github&logoColor=black&logoSize=36&cacheSeconds=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.shields.io%2Fbadge%2Fget_link-click-green%3Flogo%3Dgithub%26logoColor%3Dblack%26logoSize%3D36%26link%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkavingam%252Fadvance-sentiment-analysis-transformer%26link%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkavingam%252Fadvance-sentiment-analysis-transformer&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkavingam%2Fadvance-sentiment-analysis-transformer&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkavingam%2Fadvance-sentiment-analysis-transformer)
| NLP Projects | Transformers in NLP: Transformers revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP) by using attention mechanisms to handle sequences of text. They excel in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks like sentiment analysis and question answering, and in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks such as text completion and translation. Python, with libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers, provides powerful tools to implement, fine-tune, and deploy these models efficiently. | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/click_me-link-green?style=flat&logo=github&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkavingam%2FNLP-Research-Project-Report%2Ftree%2Fmain&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkavingam%2FNLP-Research-Project-Report%2Ftree%2Fmain)
